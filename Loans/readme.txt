Why do I feel like I am going nowhere...
Is it because I already am where I need to be?
I think I prefer chaos.
Now that I have money, a wife and direction, the excitment of uncertainty; 
something I have been so fond of for so long, now eludes me.

I wish you the best Daniel.
I wish you the best my wife, Songyi.
I love you.
